# Deployment Instructions for SecurePass Check

This is a static, client-side React application. Since it requires no backend server, database, or API keys, it can be deployed for free on almost any static hosting provider.

Below are instructions for the three most popular methods: Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub Pages.

---

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js installed** (Version 16+ recommended).
2.  **Git installed** and a GitHub account.
3.  **Project files** organized in a local directory.

---

## Option 1: Vercel (Recommended - Fastest)

1.  **Push to GitHub**:
    *   Initialize a git repository: `git init`
    *   Add files: `git add .`
    *   Commit: `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
    *   Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code there.

2.  **Connect to Vercel**:
    *   Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login.
    *   Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
    *   Select "Import" next to your GitHub repository.

3.  **Configure Build**:
    *   Framework Preset: `Vite` (or `Create React App` depending on your bundler).
    *   Build Command: `npm run build`
    *   Output Directory: `dist` (for Vite) or `build` (for CRA).
    *   *Note: If you are using the provided file structure without a specific bundler config file (vite.config.ts), ensure you have a `package.json` with a build script.*

4.  **Deploy**:
    *   Click "Deploy". Vercel will build your site and provide a live URL (e.g., `https://securepass-check.vercel.app`).

## Option 2: Netlify (Drag & Drop)

1.  **Build Locally**:
    *   Open your terminal in the project folder.
    *   Run: `npm install`
    *   Run: `npm run build`
    *   This will create a `dist` or `build` folder.

2.  **Deploy**:
    *   Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login.
    *   Go to "Sites" -> "Add new site" -> "Deploy manually".
    *   Drag and drop your `dist` (or `build`) folder into the upload area.

3.  **Live**:
    *   Netlify will immediately host your files.

## Option 3: Local Mobile Testing (Simulating Mobile View)

Since this app is designed for mobile:

1.  **Run Locally**:
    *   `npm run dev` (or `npm start`).
2.  **Access on Phone**:
    *   Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
    *   On your mobile phone (connected to the same WiFi), open the browser and visit `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:PORT` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:5173`).

## Standard package.json

If you don't have a `package.json` yet, use this standard configuration for a React/Vite app:

```json
{
  "name": "securepass-check",
  "private": true,
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.0.0",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.14",
    "postcss": "^8.4.24",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.3.2",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "vite": "^4.3.9"
  }
}
```
